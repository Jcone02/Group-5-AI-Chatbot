# 1. How to Run Your Chatbot

. **Open Terminal or Command Prompt**  
   - On **macOS**, open the **Terminal** application (you can find it in **Applications > Utilities**).  
   - On **Windows**, open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell** (search for "cmd" or "PowerShell" in the Start menu).  
   - On **Linux**, open the **Terminal** (often found in the applications menu).

. **Navigate to the Project Folder**  
   Type the following command and press **Enter**:  


2.. cd path/to/your/project
(Replace `path/to/your/project` with the location where your `Flask.py` file is stored on your local computer.)  
- On **Windows**, if your project is on a different drive (e.g., D:), use the command `D:` to switch drives before using `cd`.

3. **Install Requirements**  
If you haven't installed the required packages yet, type the following and press **Enter**: pip3 install -r requirements.txt

- (Use `pip3` to ensure the correct version of Python is used.)  
- On **Windows**, if you get an error with `pip3`, try:
  ```
  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

4. **Run the Chatbot**  
Type the following and press **Enter**:  

(Make sure you are in the correct directory where `Flask.py` is stored.)  
- On **Windows**, use the following command instead:
  ```
  python Flask.py
  ```

5. **Open the Chatbot**  
Once you see something like `Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/`, open a web browser and go to that address.

*Warning* Constant Refreshing of the app can lead to an HTTPS 403 Error.
