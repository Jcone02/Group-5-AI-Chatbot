# How to Run Your Chatbot

1. **Open Terminal**  
   Find the Terminal application on your computer and open it.

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder**  
   Type the following command and press **Enter**:  
   cd path/to/your/project  
   (Replace `path/to/your/project` with the location where your chatbot files are saved.)

3. **Install Requirements**  
   If you haven't installed the required packages yet, type the following and press **Enter**:  
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt  
   (Use `pip3` to ensure the correct version of Python is used.)

4. **Run the Chatbot**  
   Type the following and press **Enter**:  
   python3 Flask.py  
   (Replace `Flask.py` with your main Python script if it's named differently.)

5. **Open the Chatbot**  
   Once you see something like `Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/`, open a web browser and go to that address.

That's all! The chatbot should now be up and running!
